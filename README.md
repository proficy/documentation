# BOT GUIDE

### DISCLAIMER  
PROFICY is not liable for any loss of funds through the use of the available bots or connecting your wallet to our minting dashboard. This includes every possible scenario (f.e. bad trading habits, a user being victim of a cyber attack, servers being attacked, buying cryptocurrencies run by malicious developers, etc.)  

We explcitly recommend **NOT TO USE YOUR MAIN WALLET** for any of our bots or to mint an NFT through our website. This is common practice with these kind of products and should always be kept this way.  

We at PROFICY took every available measure to prevent anything bad to happen on our end.
